<p><b>Map or Location of Kampung Bandar Banting </b></p>

<blockquote><p>At the beginning of its establishment, Kampung Bandar was known as Kampung Bandar Temasya.
    This village was officially opened by the late
    DYMM Sultan Ala'eddin Sulaiman Shah Ibni Al Marhum Raja Muda Musa (V Sultan of Selangor) in 1898.
    This opening due to the administrative center of the state of Selangor under the rule of late Sultan (Sir) Abdul Samad Ibni
    The late King Abdullah (1859-1898) who was previously in Jugra moved to this village during his reign.
    Since at that time all the land was owned and administered by the King, 
    then since then the lands in this village were known and named as King's Land. 
    His Majesty the Sultan with his generous nature at that time, gave the common people land to be used
    as settlement and agriculture without charging any tax. </p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><p> In terms of Administration at that time, it was run by His Majesty the Sultan himself and power was delegated to village heads
    who were appointed for the purpose of bringing all the problems of the people to the knowledge of His Majesty the Sultan.
    The main occupations of the residents at that time were mostly farming, fishing, animal husbandry and being courtesans or working in Istana Bandar Temasya.
    Cultural activities which are synonymous activities in Malay royal society are usually presented
    and centered in Istana Bandar Temasya.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The main transport used at that time was a bicycle for those who were relatively wealthy.
    In addition, canoes and barges are also the backbone of the village community to cross and explore the Langat River.
    The rest of the villagers prefer to walk alone since at that time the village streets were 
    mostly small and narrow lanes that passed through forest areas and also residents' gardens.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>During the heyday of Kampung Bandar Temasya, several buildings were built, including the Bakly Dandan Malay School,
    the Ala'eddin Palace and the Sultan Ala'eddin mosque.
    However, only Sultan Ala'eddin Mosque is still used until now. On the other hand, Istana Ala'eddin has been renovated several times
    and in the plan it will become a museum that houses local histories in 2014
    under the supervision of the "Perbadanan Adat Malay Dan Warisan Negeri Selangor (PADAT)". Meanwhile, Dandan Bakly Malay School is only history
    after the City School was established in another, more comfortable area.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As we know, Malaya's relationship with the island of Java has started since the 14th century. 
    So it is not surprising that the migration of Javanese people to Malaya has started since long ago.
    According to oral sources, these Javanese are the pioneers of new settlements in Kampung Bandar and its surroundings.<br>
    They were recruited to clear forests, cut logs and so on. According to another source, some of these Javanese migrated<br>
    of their own volition on the basis of wanting to improve their standard of living.
    Some were even kidnapped by the human trafficking syndicate that provided the labor supply.
   Therefore, at the beginning of the opening of Kampung Bandar, the residents here already lived together 
   between the Malays and the Javanese</p></blockquote>
